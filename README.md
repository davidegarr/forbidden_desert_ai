# Forbidden Desert AI

### Overview
This project aims to develop an iterative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to play and master the cooperative board game, Forbidden Desert, designed by Matt Leacock. The goal is to create an AI model that can efficiently make decisions in the game to optimize the chances of survival and success for the team of adventurers.

### About Forbidden Desert
Forbidden Desert is a cooperative strategy board game where players form a team of adventurers stranded in a desert. The objective is to find and assemble a legendary flying machine hidden beneath the sand and escape before conditions become too harsh.

### Game Mechanics
**Board Setup**: The board consists of 24 tiles arranged in a 5x5 grid, representing different locations in the desert. One of the tiles is missing, which represent the sandstorm that moves around the desert.
**Adventurers**: Each player (2-5) assumes a role, with unique abilities, such as the Archaeologist, Climber, etc.
**Sand Markers**: As the game progresses, sand accumulates on the tiles, making them impassable until cleared.
**Water and Heat**: Players must keep their hydration levels in check and avoid dying of thirst.
**Artifacts**: Four key artifacts must be found and assembled to repair the flying machine and win the game.

### Project Goals
1. **State Representation**: Accurately represent the game state for the AI to process.
2. **Decision making**: Develop algorithms to make optimal decisions based on the current game state.
3. **Learning**: Implement machine learning techniques for the AI to iteratively improve its strategy.
3. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the model.
